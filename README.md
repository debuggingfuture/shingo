This repo is a complete web application, built on Lens Protocol for social networks https://www.lens.xyz/ and Superfluid asset streaming protocol https://www.superfluid.finance/.  For hosting, IPFS has been employed.

Shingō Social Impact App was developed for the ETHTokyo Hackathon, April 14-16 2023.  The purpose of this application is as a prototype and proof-of-concept for a social media based web application that utilizes on-chain awards to incentivize and recognize public goods providers and volunteers.

The project demo may be found here: 

We used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to create this application.  All technologies built upon here are Open Source projects, and the resulting proprietary application is also covered under MIT License for Open Source Software.
