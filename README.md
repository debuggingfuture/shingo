Shing≈ç Social Impact App was developed for the ETHTokyo Hackathon, April 14-16 2023. The purpose of this application is as a prototype and proof-of-concept for a social media based web application that utilizes on-chain awards to incentivize and recognize public goods providers and volunteers.

We used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to create this application. All technologies built upon here are Open Source projects, and the resulting proprietary application is also covered under MIT License for Open Source Software.
